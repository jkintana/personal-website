# personal-website

This is the scope of the project:
- Build a website accessible by a third-party.
- Create a static ReactJS website and host it on Heroku. 
	- Point it to my custom domain on Google Domains, jkintana.net
	- The design should be minimal and open to later iterations.
- The website contents should be:
	- A home page, which includes my bio.
	- A link to a secondary page, which is my personal blog. This has a link to:
		- My writeup on the CDIS panel.

Current progress:
- Learned about SSH and used it to commit to GitHub.
