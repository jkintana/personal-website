      <h1>Hi, I'm Jeremy Kintana.</h1>
      <h3>
      I’m a driven computer science student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, currently building skills in web development.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Previously, I interned at AI Camp, where I created historical data reports using Python Pandas and Matplotlib, and worked on a codebase that utilized React, Django, and PostgreSQL.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      I'm passionate about educational learning theory, programming, and anything science fiction or philosophy.
