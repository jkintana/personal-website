    <article><h2>History</h2><p>The treasure was re-discovered between 1908 and 1910. It was originally believed to have belonged to the church in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioch">Antioch</a>, a thriving Roman city on the Mediterranean. It can now be argued that the items come from a larger collection of silver from the church of Saint Sergios in modern-day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurin">Kurin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria">Syria</a> or that the pieces belonged to a small local church.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaper_Koraon_Treasure#cite_note-JSTOR-1">[1]</a> The final items of the collection were likely interred at the site in the seventh century as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> subsequently lost this area of Syria to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Empire">Persian</a> army. The later conquering by the Muslim Arab army permanently removed the area from Byzantine control.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaper_Koraon_Treasure#cite_note-JSTOR-1">[1]</a></p><p>It is believed that the Persian and Muslim Arab take-overs were relatively peaceful as historic sites around the area show little to no damage that could be attributed to that time. Though religion began to shift following the change of power and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity">Christian</a> artifacts were increasingly stored away from public viewing, the area did continue to benefit from relative wealth and prosperity, creating many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular">secular</a> works. The real halt to production of silver treasures is thought to have followed a plague throughout the area from 542 to 544. This had a lasting impact on the economic status of the region.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaper_Koraon_Treasure#cite_note-Dumbarton-2">[2]</a></p><p>There is evidence that this accumulation of local wealth in silver objects was common throughout the area leading up to the Persian control and the sixth century plague. Similar treasures have been found at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stuma&action=edit&redlink=1">Stuma</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariha">Riha</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hama">Hama</a>, and Antioch to name a few.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaper_Koraon_Treasure#cite_note-Dumbarton-2">[2]</a></p><p>The objects found in the Kaper Koraon treasure were not originally prestigious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrine">shrine</a> gifts but were likely relatively cheap <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imitations">imitations</a> made specifically for a village <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_(building)">church</a>. This can be clearly seen from recent investigations into the pieces which have shown high quantities of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper">copper</a> and other metals melted in with the silver to increase malleability and decrease production costs. It is estimated that these items were the collective donations from five local families over a period of at least three decades. Many of the stamps present on the pieces are believed to have been added after production and some note the specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donor">donors</a> of each piece.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaper_Koraon_Treasure#cite_note-Walters-3">[3]</a></p></article>
