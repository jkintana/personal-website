# personal-website

This is the scope of the project:
- Create a static ReactJS website.
- Point it to my custom domain on Google Domains, jkintana.net
- The website contents should be minimal, but should include:
	- A home page, which includes my bio.
	- A link to a secondary page, which is my personal blog. This has a link to:
		- My writeup on the CDIS panel.

The project scope does NOT include:
- Firebase databases.

Current progress:
- Day 1: Learned about SSH and used it to commit to GitHub.
	- Still very vague on this. Currently, I'm using Git commands, instead of the Git desktop. Current questions still include: what's a detached head, and how do I... reattach it?
- Day 2: Deployed a boilerplate React app on Heroku, and connected it to my domain.
	- Problem: It's unsecured. Also, it's complicated. I'll switch to Firebase, because it automatically secures itself, and I don't have to finangle with SSL certificates.
- Day 3: I now have the default React website hosted on my website, jkintana.net. I connected it with Firebase.
	- Problem: "Learning React" is a BIG statement. Let's break it down.
		- I found this guy on YouTube, and he's selling a course. Instead of buying it, I'm going to take the syllabus and tackle it on my own.
